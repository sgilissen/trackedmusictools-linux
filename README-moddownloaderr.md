`moddownloaderr` - a bash script that downloads tracker created module music files (.mod, .med, .xm, .it, .s3m) from modarchive.org. You can use various category or search criteria, as well as save locations for each download session, or set the maximum number of tracks to download. This is a quick way to get a huge mod library on your computer.

### History

Hint: Use + symbol instead blankspaces in search strings.
Hint 2: If you're running Mac OSX, you must first run this command before the
script will run:
  function _wget() { curl "${1}" -o $(basename "${1}") ; }; alias wget='_wget'
Hint 3: Use 'MDDEBUG=1 moddownloaderr' to enable debug output.
Hint 4: Some tracks are in more than one genre category. Use dupeguru to remove
duplicate files.
